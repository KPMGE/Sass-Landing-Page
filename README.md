# Sass Landing-Page

### Goal 
In this project, i have used the most common technologies for web development. I mean,
html and css. But along with that technologies, i have decided to use Sass.
This project was inspired by: [Sass Crash course](https://youtu.be/nu5mdN2JIwM) .

### What is Sass?
Sass extends for "syntactically awesome stylesheets". Basically, it is a superset for css.
A lot of times, Sass is referred as "css with superpowers" and, in fact, that is the case! 

### Why Sass?
With Sass we have a lot more possibilities to build interfaces compared with regular css. Sass 
looks like a programming language so that, we can automate and speed up our interface development. 

Moreover, Sass is compiled to regular css, so that, our code will be 100% compatible with all browsers.

### The final result
After some lines of Sass and html:

### Dark text feature
With Sass, we have features from programming languages, just like loops, variables, conditionals and all of the good stuff.
That is extremely helpful, because we can encapsulate our logic in a more concise way. A simple use case of it is in our text-based on background feature. Basically, depending on the brightness of the page all of our texts get the right color. As we can see in the image below, as soon as we set a lighter color for the background, our text gets black automatically.

### Running the project
if you want to see that project in your machine, it is very easy. You can just clone this repository and then open the `index.html` file in some browser. 
If you want to modify the code and see the result, it is important to have the `nodejs` installed in your machine. Then,
you could run the command `npm install` and the command `npm run dev`. Now, the sass code will be compiled every time you make a change automatically! Have fun!
